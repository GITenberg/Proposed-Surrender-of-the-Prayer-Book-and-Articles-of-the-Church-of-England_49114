<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Brompton</span>,
<i>Whitsuntide</i>, 1863.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> twenty years ago, soon after a
few of the clergy had asserted their &ldquo;claim to hold all
Roman doctrine,&rdquo; <a name="citation3"></a><a
href="#footnote3" class="citation">[3]</a> a proposal had been
made to abolish Subscription to the English Formularies, it would
surely have been thought to indicate very grave disloyalty to our
Church.&nbsp; And now, when others have asserted the right to
unfettered &ldquo;free-thinking&rdquo; within her pale, and
endeavoured to vindicate that right in our Courts of Law, can we
help being struck at the intrepidity of the demand to sweep away
at once the sober restraints of orthodoxy to which Churchmen have
been so long accustomed?</p>
<p>Your Lordship has been openly addressed, as we are all aware,
in behalf of this &ldquo;Relaxation of Subscription;&rdquo; but
as our Bishop&mdash;so deeply interested in the welfare of the
whole Church&mdash;I venture to believe that you will do justice
to opposite views, and in offering them to your attention, I rely
on that broad-minded charity to various schools among us, which
has marked your Lordship&rsquo;s administration of this
diocese.</p>
<h3><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Dr.
Stanley&rsquo;s position. <a name="citation4a"></a><a
href="#footnote4a" class="citation">[4a]</a></h3>
<p>The eloquent advocacy of Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span> on the other side is, indeed, no
slight advantage to the cause of those who would now supersede
the Prayer-book by &ldquo;modern thought.&rdquo;&nbsp; In urging
the surrender of all Subscription to our Formularies, he can
speak, in his position, with a <i>prestige</i> and power to which
I can have no claim.&nbsp; His testimony as to the tone of mind
now prevailing in Oxford, or among the younger clergy of the last
few years, it is not for me to impeach,&mdash;I must leave that
to the Bishop of Oxford; <a name="citation4b"></a><a
href="#footnote4b" class="citation">[4b]</a> but certain of his
deductions from very limited facts, I may be permitted, I think,
to call in question at once.&nbsp; As one who, without belonging
to any party, has had the happiness of much friendship with
all&mdash;as a Churchman, I may add, who has kept steadily to the
old Prayer-book from very early childhood till now&mdash;I have
had large opportunities for many years of knowing the heart and
mind of my brethren the clergy, ten thousand of whom not long
since responded to an appeal which I and others had been invited
to make to them; and I confess that I am amazed at Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley&rsquo;s</span> supposition that
Subscription is regarded as a &ldquo;grievance&rdquo; (p. 23), a
&ldquo;perjury&rdquo; (p. 24), an &ldquo;absurdity&rdquo; (p.
20), or an &ldquo;imposition&rdquo; (p. 7) by any considerable
number among us.&nbsp; Allowing for some irritable minds here and
there, the generality have seemed to me to have the deepest
appreciation of the &ldquo;quietness and confidence&rdquo; which
have been, in the main, secured for our Church by the present
laws, <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>which
simply bind the clergy to say that they <i>believe</i> the
Prayers which they use, and the Articles which they adopt as
their &ldquo;standard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus much I have felt compelled to say at the outset, because
the opposers of Subscription assume that their clients are so
numerous that to refuse their demands may be to endanger the
Church herself.&nbsp; True, they generously disclaim all designs
&ldquo;to revolutionize the Church of England&rdquo; (p. 6 of
<i>The Letter</i>).&nbsp; This is well; but I am far more assured
by the belief that their power, as yet, is not so formidable as
their intentions.&nbsp; And with this preface, I would pass to
the subject-matter of Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley&rsquo;s</span> <i>Letter</i>.</p>
<h2>Scheme of Comprehension.</h2>
<p>The point of departure taken for the discussion is the <span
class="smcap">Revolution</span> of 1688, and the attempt then
made at what was called &ldquo;Comprehension.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
even suggested that the &ldquo;High Churchmen&rdquo; of those
days agreed that the &ldquo;very being of our Church was
concerned&rdquo; in abolishing &ldquo;Subscription,&rdquo; and
substituting for it a general declaration of conformity.&nbsp;
The several attempts at &ldquo;Comprehension&rdquo; almost seem
to be referred to as substantially one, and are recommended to us
as if originated by enlarged and exemplary views of the
Church&rsquo;s calling.&nbsp; But, equivocations apart, (which
would be wholly unworthy here), will this be gravely
maintained?&nbsp; Did the &ldquo;Comprehension Scheme&rdquo; of
1674 receive no opposition from the Church? or will not every one
own that it was frustrated by the <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>resistance of the Bishops?&nbsp; Would
Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> really say that the Scheme
(not &ldquo;Act&rdquo;) of 1689 was founded on a philosophy which
would now command assent?&nbsp; I suppose that he must say it, or
how could he refer to it as our rebuke and pattern?&nbsp; Yet it
was, as he will not deny, a political effort directed against the
Roman Catholics; and the reluctance of the clergy (even under all
the pressure of the occasion) to fraternize with Nonconformists,
defeated the measure,&mdash;some of the principal Commissioners
who had to manage it, such as the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, the
Prolocutor of Convocation, and the Bishop of Rochester, openly
withdrawing from it.&nbsp; I really can hardly conceive of a more
unfortunate appeal to history.&nbsp; To represent the clergy of
all parties, and especially &ldquo;High Churchmen&rdquo; (p. 33),
as approving, on liberal principles, of the proposed
&ldquo;Comprehension,&rdquo; and covertly to suggest that
&ldquo;Subscription&rdquo; was alien from the spirit of those
enlightened days, is, to speak gently of it, quite
&ldquo;unhistorical&rdquo;&mdash;(if I may so apply a now
familiar term); nor can I forbear to point to the fact that even
Dissenters were required, by the Act of 1 William and Mary, cap.
18, to &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; a declaration that &ldquo;the Holy
Scriptures of the Old and New Testament were given by Divine
Inspiration.&rdquo;&nbsp; The parallel breaks down at every
point.&nbsp; Of course, if any one really thinks that England is
now in great danger (as in Sancroft&rsquo;s days) from the Popish
encroachments of the <span class="smcap">Crown</span>, such an
one is free to argue as Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>does.&nbsp; If
any suppose that a Papal reaction among the populace is the
present peril (as it was thought to be in Burnet&rsquo;s days),
let them by all means fly to the &ldquo;remedial&rdquo; measures
of that era.&nbsp; But for a philosophical historian to quote,
with admiration, Halifax or Nottingham, or refer to certain
&ldquo;High Churchmen&rdquo; with approval, can but cause a
smile. <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p>It was a popular beginning of this subject, doubtless, to
invoke the memories of 1688 and the &ldquo;Toleration Act,&rdquo;
in order to recommend to English people this proposal to destroy
&ldquo;Subscription;&rdquo; yet it was dangerous.&nbsp; For to
have pursued the subject fairly from this point would hardly have
assisted the views of the abolitionists.&nbsp; The course of
history would very soon have brought them to the great
<i>Arian</i> conspiracy of 1772, the next noticeable effort to
set aside the Articles of the Church.&nbsp; This, however, is
altogether avoided, as if it were unknown to Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span>; and he quickly goes back to the
Reformation, and even to the times of the Primitive Church, to
find arguments against &ldquo;Subscription&rdquo; in the
abstract, (as well as against our special Anglican form of
it,)&mdash;and, must I not say, to get out of the way of <span
class="smcap">Whiston</span>, and the &ldquo;Feathers&rsquo;
Tavern&rdquo;?&nbsp; Let us, then, be generous, and forgive the
allusions to 1688, and forget all that followed, and endeavour to
examine on its merits the substance of the
&ldquo;<i>Letter</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;Relaxation&rdquo; a preliminary movement.</h3>
<p>The object, my Lord, of the rising movement against
&ldquo;Subscription,&rdquo; here appears to be of a purely
<i>preliminary</i> character.&nbsp; It is expressly cleared of
all connexion with special grievances.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Revisions&rdquo; are to stand over.&nbsp; These are
understood to be reserved for future treatment (p. 4).&nbsp;
Meanwhile, it is not against the &ldquo;Articles&rdquo; only that
the feeling is to be stirred, but &ldquo;Subscription&rdquo; to
the whole Prayer-book, and even to the Bible (p. 51), is gently
deprecated.&nbsp; Indeed, it seems to be maintained that our
present &ldquo;Subscription&rdquo; to the Articles does not
include, as we had supposed, Subscription to the Bible at
all.&nbsp; The objection, however, is scarcely raised in that
form.&nbsp; It is to &ldquo;Subscribing&rdquo; <i>per se</i> that
the repugnance is felt, as though there were a morbid dread of
&ldquo;putting the hand to paper,&rdquo;&mdash;such as we
sometimes find in the uneducated classes.&nbsp; And now it is not
so much &ldquo;do not sign <i>these</i> forms,&rdquo; as
&ldquo;do not sign <i>any</i> thing;&rdquo; and Dr. Whately, and
Archdeacon Denison, and the friends of Mr. Gorham, Dr. Rowland
Williams, and Mr. Bristowe Wilson, and Mr. Heath are, as I
understand, urged for once to agree to &ldquo;relax all
subscriptions,&rdquo; that they may so be set at more liberty to
fight their mutual battles without hindrance.&nbsp; Thus it is,
wonderfully, to be claimed for members of a Christian Church,
that they should be positively pledged to nothing!</p>
<h2>Revision of Prayer-book.</h2>
<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Ebury&rsquo;s</span> measure in the
House of Lords did not go this length, because he had
&ldquo;Revision&rdquo; more definitely in view; but his arguments
against <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>one
form of Subscription are equally valid against all, so that its
entire abrogation is, on his principles, only a question of
time.&nbsp; There is, however, substantial agreement.</p>
<p>It is most important that this should be understood, and that
no false issue be raised: and this is why I speak of the present
proposal as one for the Surrender of the Prayer-book.&nbsp; Dr.
<span class="smcap">Stanley</span> would ask nothing so small as
<i>altering</i> Articles or Liturgy; a far simpler way he would
show us.&nbsp; Revision would be mere &lsquo;nibbling&rsquo;
while Subscription remained.&nbsp; An Act of the Legislature
might just &ldquo;prohibit,&rdquo; he says, (p. 32) all
&ldquo;Subscription.&rdquo;&mdash;Are men, then, so eager for it,
that prohibition must be resorted to?&nbsp; He would not even
leave it open to any one to sign; for thus he triumphantly
proceeds:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Not a word</i> of the Articles need be
touched.&nbsp; They would still be left as the exposition of the
Faith of the <i>Church of England in the eighteenth
century</i>!&mdash;as the <i>standard</i> of its faith at the
present day.&nbsp; <i>Not a word</i> of the Liturgy need be
touched.&nbsp; There are, no doubt, changes which would be
acceptable to many, but <span class="GutSmall">THEY MUST BE
EFFECTED BY OTHER MEANS</span>,&rdquo; (p. 33.)&mdash;Surely,
said the wise man, &ldquo;in vain is the net spread in the sight
of any bird.&rdquo;&nbsp; To tell us beforehand that we are to be
coaxed into a general movement to get rid of Subscription, and,
that being done, we must reckon on the subsequent change of the
Prayer-book &ldquo;by <span class="GutSmall">OTHER
MEANS</span>,&rdquo; seems so very like an insult to the
understanding of <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>men of all parties who believe anything, that I can only
explain it by calling to mind the proverbial blindness of genius
when hotly hastening to its own object, and forgetting how it
looks to all around.</p>
<p>But it may be said that I am overlooking that the Articles and
Prayer-book, though not &ldquo;signed&rdquo; or
&ldquo;subscribed,&rdquo; might still remain&mdash;at least, for
a time&mdash;as what is called the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; of our
doctrine.&nbsp; Let us inquire, then, what this means; for,
unless we look it steadily in the face, we shall be deluding
ourselves again by an ambiguous word.&nbsp; It is suggested by
the passage quoted from Burnet (p. 7), and in the argument of Dr.
<span class="smcap">Stanley</span>, that we English are generally
governed in other matters by Acts of Parliament,&mdash;and why
not in religion?&nbsp; We are not expected to
&ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; the law of the land, but simply to
acquiesce, and submit to it.&nbsp; It is not binding on the
conscience, but only on external obedience.&nbsp; A man may stand
up and read a Statute to others&mdash;and then argue against
it.&nbsp; While it exists as law, he must be judged and ruled by
it; but he is free to dislike it, and may labour to change
it.&nbsp; This is the parallel suggested, or if it be not, I have
no idea of what is intended; and I must say, that when thus
nakedly looked at, it is the most unveiled Erastianism avowed in
our times, if we except Mr. <span class="smcap">Bristowe
Wilson&rsquo;s</span> in his Essay.&nbsp; It is what we might
expect of Burnet, but scarcely of Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span>, to make the Prayer-book &ldquo;a
legal standard,&rdquo; but not a matter of belief: it simply
astonishes us.&nbsp; When a great statesman of the last age <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>told us that
our religion was but a &ldquo;schedule of an Act of
Parliament,&rdquo; we could at least reply that &ldquo;ex
animo&rdquo; Subscription makes it <i>our own</i>; but to ask us
now to take away even this, seems almost to sever all connexion
between the Church of England and the moral agency of her
Ministers.&nbsp; The Act of 1662, and its &ldquo;schedule,&rdquo;
the Prayer-book, might be our &ldquo;standard&rdquo; till the
next session, and might claim as much reverence as any other old
Act of Parliament,&mdash;but no more.&nbsp; Put the whole
proposal, then, of Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>, and of
Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, and others into plain
English, and it is this&mdash;(and I ask to be corrected if I
misinterpret it)&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Let the clergy in future
sign</i> <span class="GutSmall">NOTHING</span>, <i>but let them
consent to adopt and use what the</i> <span
class="smcap">Parliament</span> <i>may from time to time
authorise</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The object, then, being thus simplified, we need not here
pause to estimate the excellences or defects of any of the
formularies which we all alike have thought to be good enough to
<i>sign</i>.&nbsp; With more than judicial fairness, Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span> admits that the whole Thirty-nine
Articles are &ldquo;incomparably superior&rdquo; to the
&ldquo;Nine Articles of the Evangelical Alliance&rdquo; (p. 11),
or any that would be drawn up by &ldquo;the dominant
factions&rdquo; of our Church, <i>or Commonwealth</i>.&nbsp; But
this kind of criticism may well be postponed till the prior
question is disposed of&mdash;whether we should
&ldquo;sign&rdquo; <i>any</i> thing?&nbsp; When the Articles and
Prayer-book come to be hereafter discussed, these details may
have interest with some, as parts of the literature of the
&ldquo;<i>Eighteenth Century</i>;&rdquo; but at <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>present might
it not be disrespectful merely to glance at them in a sketchy
way, to give pungency and interest to a somewhat barren
subject?&nbsp; I do not say that the highly rhetorical sentences
in which praise and blame are judiciously administered by Dr.
<span class="smcap">Stanley</span> to Article 1, 5, 9, or 34,
contribute nothing to the effectiveness of the pamphlet with the
&ldquo;general reader;&rdquo; but it is obvious that with the
argument, strictly speaking, they have nothing to do.</p>
<h3>Dr. Stanley&rsquo;s Three Arguments.</h3>
<p>The Relaxation of Subscription appears, as far as I can
gather, to be urged by three arguments,&mdash;the first founded
the <i>origin</i> of the &ldquo;Subscriptions&rdquo; among us
after the Reformation; the second, on the alleged absence of
&ldquo;Subscription&rdquo; in the Primitive Church; and the third
on the practical evils of the present state of
&ldquo;Subscription&rdquo; in the Church and in the
Universities.&nbsp; If I examine each of these, I shall not, I
think, have omitted any point hitherto prominently alleged in
this controversy.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Church of England, as such, recognises
absolutely no Subscriptions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley&rsquo;s</span> proposition (p. 38).&nbsp;
The tests of membership are &ldquo;incorporated in the Services
to the exclusion, as it would seem, of all besides.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is added (p. 39)&mdash;&ldquo;These other obligations were, in
fact, <i>not contemplated</i> at the time of the first
compilation of the Prayer-book and Articles, and have grown up as
a mere excrescence through the pressure of political and
ecclesiastical parties.&nbsp; The <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Articles were not subscribed (by
anything like general usage) till the 12th year of Elizabeth;
they were then, after much hesitation and opposition, ordered to
be subscribed for a special purpose,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<h4>The Reformation.</h4>
<p>Is it possible to suppose that Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span> means this for a fair representation
of the spirit and design of the Church of England, from the
beginning of the Reformation to the 12th year of Elizabeth?&nbsp;
He writes as though the Articles were all really to be signed,
and the Prayer-book all settled, and that the Church during all
that time deliberately intended to leave her members such freedom
of opinion as he and others would now restore.&nbsp; If he does
not mean this, his argument falls to the ground.&nbsp; But what
are the facts of the case?</p>
<p>Elizabeth ascended the throne at the close of the year
1558.&nbsp; Every position of trust throughout the country was
then held by Roman Catholics.&nbsp; The bishops and the clergy
were generally devoted to Rome.&nbsp; The Convocation met, in two
months, and drew up Articles presented to Parliament, which are
described as &ldquo;flat against Reformation, and
<i>subscribed</i> by most of the University.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even
Cambridge is said to have given her approval.&nbsp; At such a
crisis, it was evident that some years must elapse before any
such Revision of Edward VI.&rsquo;s Articles could be hoped for,
as would obtain general consent.&nbsp; But to represent this
pause as a kind of freedom from &ldquo;Subscription&rdquo;
enjoyed in earlier and more liberal times, to say that &ldquo;the
Church,&rdquo; at least, was ignorant of this device, when
&ldquo;Subscription&rdquo; to <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>certain &ldquo;Articles&rdquo; was
the first step which the Convocation and the Universities
naturally took, immediately Elizabeth came to the throne,
surprises me beyond what I like to express.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;general reader&rdquo; is entirely at the mercy of so
eloquent a writer as Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>, and
it is not too much to ask that he use his power with a little
generosity; or if he will not, it becomes imperative that his
representations be translated into a humbler style, that the
world may judge how they look.&nbsp; The facts of the case are,
in truth, opposed to all that Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley&rsquo;s</span> argument requires.&nbsp;
Instead of the twenty years and more, which preceded
Elizabeth&rsquo;s 12th year, being years in which the Church of
the Reformation adopted laxity as its principle, the whole of the
period, from the beginning of the reign of Edward to the year
1571 (with the exception of the brief interval of Mary&rsquo;s
government), was occupied in a careful effort on the part of the
Reformers to tie down both clergy and laity by the strictest body
of ecclesiastical law, perhaps, ever attempted to be enacted in
the Christian world.</p>
<h4>The Reformatio Legum.</h4>
<p>I refer, of course, to the &ldquo;Reformatio
Legum.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Archbishop of Canterbury, the
subsequently-elect Archbishop of York, and certain suffragans;
great Reformers, such as Peter Martyr and Rowland Taylour; known
scholars, such as Sir John Cheke and Dr. Haddon, were engaged in
this business, which was looked to as the crowning act of the
Reformation of Religion.&nbsp; Archbishop Parker took up the work
which Cranmer had <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>begun, and even pressed it on the reluctant Queen as far
as he dared.</p>
<h4>Subscription demanded in 1553.</h4>
<p>The connexion of the <i>Reformatio Legum</i> with the Articles
of our Church, and the light which they throw on each other, I
need not point out to any who are acquainted with the history of
our Church at that time.&nbsp; The Forty-two Articles, from which
our Thirty-nine were, ten years afterwards, derived, were first
published in 1553.&nbsp; In the November of the preceding year,
Cranmer proposed that the bishops should have them at once
<i>subscribed</i> throughout their dioceses.&nbsp; The death of
King Edward prevented this from being accomplished.&nbsp; They
were revised and subscribed by Convocation in 1563, in the name
of the whole clergy of England.&nbsp; The early chapters of the
<i>Reformatio Legum</i> contain the doctrine of the Articles, and
were, no doubt, intended to be an authorized exposition of
them.&nbsp; How strict a system was meant to be inaugurated by
the Reformers may be judged by even a superficial perusal of that
Book.&nbsp; Heresy and blasphemy were to be punishable by
death.&nbsp; Adultery was to be visited with imprisonment and
even banishment.&nbsp; Impenitent persons were to be
&ldquo;handed over to the civil power.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this was
the sort of Discipline which was waiting to be put in force as
soon as the Reformers could persuade the nation to bear
it;&mdash;and yet this is the supposed time when Subscription was
alien from the mind of the Reformed Church!</p>
<h4>Temporary restriction of the Clergy.<br />
Subscription in 1564.</h4>
<p>But during this interval of twelve years, while <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the bishops
were doing their best to bring the clergy and people to
Uniformity, and preparing them for the &ldquo;Discipline&rdquo;
which was openly clamoured for, we find that immediately after
the Articles were published, &ldquo;advertisements&rdquo; came
out by authority further to restrain the liberty of the
preachers.&nbsp; In 1564, the clergy, who had by their proctors
subscribed the Articles in Convocation, were required &ldquo;to
protest and <i>subscribe</i>&rdquo; that they would not preach at
all without special license from the bishop, but &ldquo;only read
that which is appointed by public authority:&rdquo; and further,
that they would &ldquo;observe, keep, and maintain, all the
rites, ceremonies, good usages and order&rdquo; set forth by the
Act of Uniformity.&nbsp; Here then was &ldquo;Subscription&rdquo;
to the whole Prayer-book as it then stood.&nbsp; And, indeed,
even three years before, the &ldquo;readers&rdquo; in Churches
were obliged, by &ldquo;Subscriptions&rdquo; to certain
injunctions, to execute their office within prescribed and narrow
limits.&nbsp; The state of things doubtless was still felt on all
hands to be but provisional.&nbsp; The great Roman Catholic party
waited, without separating formally.&nbsp; The Puritans were
stirring themselves in the cause of &ldquo;Discipline:&rdquo; it
was hoped by both parties that some change might, from the lapse
of a few years, better their position.&nbsp; The latter reckoned
on the more aged of the old Popish Clergy dying out; the former
were encouraged by a fanatical prophecy to expect the death of
the Queen herself in the twelfth year of her reign; but after
that time the Puritan and <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Popish parties became openly defined,
while the Church had as yet no such &ldquo;Discipline&rdquo; as
could hold her members together at all, except by the Court of
Commissioners.&nbsp; It was to restrain both parties, then, that
recourse was once more had to &ldquo;Subscription.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can there be need, my Lord, to pursue any further an inquiry
into so well known a piece of history as this?&nbsp; I should not
have said so much, had not the Ecclesiastical History Professor
declared that Subscriptions and Declarations of Faith were
&ldquo;not in fact <i>contemplated</i> at the time of the first
compilation of the Prayer Book and Articles;&rdquo; that
Subscription is &ldquo;superfluous,&rdquo;
&ldquo;needless,&rdquo; &ldquo;capricious,&rdquo;
&ldquo;extrinsic,&rdquo; and &ldquo;accidental,&rdquo; (pp. 38,
39), &ldquo;and that the Church of England, as such, recognises
absolutely no Subscriptions!&rdquo;&nbsp; I submit to your
Lordship, that the Church of England &ldquo;at the time of the
first compilation of the Articles and Prayer Book,&rdquo;
encouraged no freedom whatever to diverge from the one or the
other&mdash;demanded Subscription (by Cranmer) in
1553&mdash;<i>obtained</i> it from all the bishops and
representatives of the clergy in Convocation in 1563&mdash;and
laboured to restrain both Papists and Puritans within more and
more rigid limits year by year, till by the thirteenth of
Elizabeth &ldquo;Subscription&rdquo; was universally enforced, as
the only practical substitute for that Ecclesiastical Discipline
which was refused.</p>
<p>I have purposely abstained from here noticing minor
inaccuracies which singularly abound in the <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>learned
Professor&rsquo;s letter, and have kept to the main point.&nbsp;
His position is that since the twelfth year of Elizabeth, a stern
and gradual growth of Subscription has superseded the liberal
system of the earlier years in which the tolerant Church
&ldquo;knew <i>absolutely nothing</i> of
Subscription!&rdquo;&nbsp; Without this, again I say, his
argument comes utterly to an end.&nbsp; It will be useless to
weigh syllables, and retreat upon the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of
the Letter.&nbsp; The broad representation means this, or it is
<i>nihil ad rem</i>.&nbsp; And the whole history of the period is
again, directly the reverse of the representation given by Dr.
<span class="smcap">Stanley</span>. <a name="citation18"></a><a
href="#footnote18" class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<h3>The Primitive Church.</h3>
<p>II.&nbsp; I pass, then, to the next point&mdash;the alleged
absence of Subscription in the primitive age.&nbsp; Not content
with the reference to the history of our own Church, Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span> says:&mdash;&ldquo;I will not
confine myself to these isolated instances, but examine the
history of Subscription from the first.&nbsp; For the first three
centuries the Church was <i>entirely without it</i>.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The first Subscription to a series of dogmatical
propositions as such was that enforced by Constantine at the
Council of Nic&aelig;a.&nbsp; It was the natural, but rude,
expedient of a half-educated soldier to enforce unanimity in the
Church as he had by the sword enforced it in the empire.&rdquo;
(p. 35).&nbsp; <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>Again, I am painfully compelled to meet the statements
of Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> with a direct
negative.&nbsp; The case is <i>not</i> as he states it.&nbsp; A
&ldquo;rude soldier,&rdquo; in those days&mdash;(when
comparatively few people <i>wrote</i> at all)&mdash;would not, I
think, have been likely to invent this &ldquo;expedient:&rdquo;
but, in fact, he <i>did not</i> invent it.</p>
<h4>Council against Paulus Samosatemus.</h4>
<p>I do not suppose for a moment that Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span> could care to make a merely
<i>technical</i> statement as to the mode in which adhesion was
signified to a dogmatic series of propositions.&nbsp; No merely
formal position of that kind could serve the argument.&nbsp; The
position which he lays down must be that, before the time of
Constantine, there was that <i>freedom</i> allowed which is
demanded by those who object to Subscription now,&mdash;that
people were not, in those days, called on to profess their belief
in any set of &ldquo;dogmatical&rdquo; statements as tests of
orthodoxy.&nbsp; If, then, he will look back sixty-six years
before the Council of Nic&aelig;a, to the Council of Antioch (of
which Constantine was quite innocent), against Paul of Samosata,
there he will find the copy of a letter from certain orthodox
bishops, Hymen&aelig;us, Theophilus, Theoctenus, Maximus,
Proclus, and Bolanus, setting forth a series of dogmatical
propositions, more minute and lengthened than those of
Nic&aelig;a, and concluding with these
words&mdash;&Tau;&alpha;&#8166;&tau;&alpha; &#7936;&pi;&#8056;

Rel.</i> ii. p. 465, &amp;c.</p>
<h4>Council against Noetus.</h4>
<p>A few years earlier, the case of Noetus was treated in a
similar way.&nbsp; The assembled Presbyters, after confessing the
orthodox faith, cast out the heretic for <i>not submitting to
it</i>.&nbsp; The Council of Eliberis, in Spain (before the
Nicene Council), put out eighty-one canons, or chapters, of a
mixed kind, dogmatical and disciplinary, &ldquo;et Post
<i>Subscriptiones</i> Episcoporum in vetusto codice Urgelensi
leguntur sequentes presbyterorum,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&mdash;<i>Routh</i>, iv. 44.&nbsp; Doctrine of Novatian
severity is there put forth: I refer to it not for any other
purpose than to adduce the <i>fact</i> of Subscription&mdash;(and
Subscription, too, in the presence of the laity),&mdash;or at
least the fact, that there was no authorized laxity in those
days, such as Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley&rsquo;s</span>
argument requires.</p>
<h4>Discipline in the Church.</h4>
<p>And here I would remark, my Lord, on the obvious difference
between a state of the Church in which there was a system of
<span class="smcap">Discipline</span> holding together the whole
body, and a condition like our own, when Discipline is
acknowledged to be extinct among us.&nbsp; When bishops met
together periodically, as they then did, to regulate the affairs
of the Church,&mdash;and stood in mutual awe of each
other&rsquo;s spiritual powers;&mdash;when dismissal from
Communion was a chastisement shrunk from, by laity and clergy,
with terror,&mdash;it might have been easy to do without such
Subscriptions as now attempt to guard the orthodoxy <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>of our
people.&nbsp; So again in the Pre-Reformation Church; the
organization of the hierarchy, and the necessary submission of
the people, might often render Subscriptions more than
superfluous&mdash;unintelligible.&nbsp; Let those who would take
away the present Subscription to our Prayer-book, restore to us,
in a fair measure, the active Discipline of the Apostolic and
post Apostolic times, and I for one will thankfully hail the
change.&nbsp; But to ask to return to the &ldquo;first three
centuries,&rdquo;&mdash;bristling as they do with canons,
synodical and episcopal letters, and declarations,&mdash;because
a volume was not then presented for the signature of every
candidate for Orders,&mdash;is as reasonable as it would be to
propose now to abolish printing, and go back to the simplicity
and &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; of oral instruction and the scantiest
of manuscript literature.&nbsp; There is no fallacy more
glittering, but none more unworthy, illogical, and
self-condemning than that of false historical parallel.&nbsp; And
I again must ask your Lordship, whether Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley&rsquo;s</span> appeal to the Primitive
History has not wholly failed?&mdash;I have briefly shown that
Constantine was not the originator of Subscriptions to creeds or
canons, but that subscribing or professing dogmatic assent was a
Christian custom of the earlier ages.&nbsp; It is plain to every
one who knows the history, <i>e.g.</i>, of a great bishop like
St. Cyprian or St. Iren&aelig;us, or of a great writer like
Tertullian or Origen, that to guard dogmatically against heresy,
by every means in their power, was the predominating idea of
their whole course, however <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>imperfectly attained; and they would
have been utterly astounded if any one had foretold that in a
future age of the Church, when all Discipline had been destroyed
among <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> people, a
Professor of History would appeal to <i>their</i> example as a
justification of the proposal to excuse all ministers of Christ
from signing any Articles of Faith!</p>
<h4>Roman Catholic Subscription.</h4>
<p>But when we are even told by Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span> (p. 36, n.) that, &ldquo;from the
clergy of the Roman Catholic Church no <i>declaration of
belief</i> is required at their Ordination,&rdquo; we almost
cease to be surprised at his allegations respecting the
ante-Nicene age.&nbsp; One would have thought it very little
trouble to look into the present Roman Pontifical, and see the
service for Ordination of Priests, before making any such
statement.&nbsp; Unless Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley&rsquo;s</span> copy is very different from
mine&mdash;(Antverpi&aelig; <i>Ex-officina Plantiniana</i>
Balthasaris Moreti, 1663)&mdash;he will read thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pontifex, accepta mitra, vertit se ad
presbyteros ordinatos qui ante altare coram ipso stantes
<i>profitentur Fidem</i> quam pr&aelig;dicaturi sunt, dicentes
<span class="smcap">Credo</span>, &amp;c., &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Protestant Subscriptions.</h4>
<p>I think that I need add no more on this head: but I will refer
to the Subscriptions of Protestant Churches, before I pass
on.&nbsp; It is very commonly said at present that
&ldquo;Subscription&rdquo; does not secure the Uniformity of
opinion which it aims at, and thus shows itself to be as useless
as it is vexatious,&mdash;(as if, forsooth, any one supposed that
absolute uniformity of thought could be attained by <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>any means in
the world).&nbsp; Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> has not
omitted this; but once more I must hold him to facts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was one of the misfortunes,&rdquo; (he says, p. 36)
&ldquo;incident to the Reformation, that every Protestant Church
by way of defending itself against the enemies that hemmed it in,
or that <i>were supposed to</i> hem it in on every side, was
induced to compile each for itself a <i>new</i> Confession of
Faith.&rdquo;&mdash;This is scarcely doing justice to our
Protestant friends, <i>in limine</i>.&nbsp; They had to do
something more than defend themselves against enemies; they had
to form some bond of union among themselves.&nbsp; If they were
not to be merely scattered units, to be attracted in time to the
largest bodies near them, they were obliged to find some
principle of cohesion among themselves; and they who refuse to
allow them to make &ldquo;articles&rdquo; or
&ldquo;confessions&rdquo; ought in charity to suggest some other
plan.&nbsp; To have separated from a compact body like the Roman
Church and profess <i>nothing</i> positive, was surely an
impossible course.&mdash;But Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span> further says, &ldquo;The excess of
Subscription on the continent over-leaped itself and has led to
its gradual extinction, or modification.&rdquo; (p. 37.)</p>
<p>It seems to me a very narrow philosophy which thus disposes of
so great a fact as this, that &ldquo;<i>every</i> Protestant
Church&rdquo; had this sort of instinct of life and
self-preservation.&nbsp; Is it not as legitimate at least to
infer that there may have been something in the very nature of
things to prompt this unanimity <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>of action?&nbsp; And is there no
lesson to be learned from the undoubted fact that none of the
Protestant communities have preserved their original standard,
but have descended towards neology everywhere in proportion as
&ldquo;Subscription&rdquo; has been set aside? and that the
Church of England has for three hundred years exhibited a
singular uniformity of belief, while maintaining her
Subscriptions?&nbsp; Practically, I see nothing, then, in the
example of Foreign Protestantism to encourage the proposed
relaxation; but everything the reverse.&nbsp; Even the small and
diminishing bodies of Nonconformists in England have failed,
(notwithstanding their gaining in orthodoxy by their proximity to
us), to keep up their reputation,&mdash;as their ablest men
allow.&nbsp; But what would have been their condition, if, like
ourselves, they had had no Discipline? <a
name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a>&nbsp; Surely in their efforts at holy
Discipline they all bear a witness for <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> which puts us to shame.</p>
<p>Let Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>, if he can, find
any Christian body without Discipline&mdash;without Confessions,
without Articles, without Subscriptions, which has been able to
preserve itself at all; for until he does so, we must tell him
that <i>all</i> the facts are against him.</p>
<h3><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>Alleged practical evils of Subscription.</h3>
<p>III.&nbsp; I now, my Lord, must pass to the third topic, in
the consideration of which I thought to include all that remains
in Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley&rsquo;s</span> pamphlet which
could be supposed by any to be of argumentative value&mdash;viz.,
the alleged practical evils of &ldquo;Subscription&rdquo; in the
Church and the University.&nbsp; Here I feel that our English
people will take a deeper interest in the matter, than in any
antiquarian or historical disquisitions; and here Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span> and his friends speak with a
confidence which with many will pass at once for
demonstration.&nbsp; And if there were grounds to suppose that a
method of Subscription, like ours, worked such mischief as they
say who call for this change, no traditions of the Revolution, or
of the Reformation, or of the Primitive Church, ought to tempt us
to retain it.&nbsp; But let us not put the matter in an unreal
light, while pretending to go back to former and better
days.&nbsp; Freedom to think as you please in Religion, while
retaining your place in the Church, was never conceded at any of
the times to which Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> has
appealed; but was foreign to the principles of every class of
Christians.&nbsp; Yet if the evils of Subscriptions are such as
we are now assured, things cannot be suffered to remain as they
are.</p>
<p>But broad assertions can frequently be only met by like broad
assertions; and I hope that I shall not be thought disrespectful
if I thus treat some now before me.</p>
<h4>&ldquo;Contradictoriness&rdquo; of the Articles and
Prayer-book.</h4>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; It is said that the Subscriptions are made to <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>documents
&ldquo;contradictory to each other in spirit;&rdquo; (p. 22) and
that this is felt by those who are called on to sign the
Prayer-book, and the Articles;&mdash;the former being devotional
and sublime, the latter scholastic, and less
impressive;&mdash;the former emanating from ancient sources, the
latter being the product &ldquo;of the Calvinistic, and in some
measure even the Scholastic period.&rdquo; (pp. 16, 17.)&nbsp;
This is popularly but scarcely correctly put; but I would ask,
whether the difference between the &ldquo;two documents&rdquo; is
greater than between Aquinas&rsquo; <i>Summa</i>, and his
<i>Pange Lingua</i>?&mdash;or between any man&rsquo;s didactic
statements and his devotional offices?&nbsp; And if not, then how
cannot the same man honestly sign both&mdash;each in its plain
and obvious sense?&nbsp; Personally, I do not feel the least
difficulty in the case; and I cannot recollect meeting with any
clergyman who could sign the one, and yet had difficulty about
the other, except as to a few phrases here and there.&nbsp; The
general &ldquo;contradictoriness,&rdquo; which is affirmed by Dr.
<span class="smcap">Stanley</span>, I believe then is not
commonly perceived by the Clergy, and I do not myself perceive
any other difference than the nature of the case demands.&nbsp;
The purely Theological language of the earlier
Articles&mdash;then the mixed statements of the
&ldquo;anthropology,&rdquo; as it is called&mdash;and the terms
of the Sacramental Articles,&mdash;may almost in every instance
be traced in Catholic fathers, from St. Augustine to St.
Bernard.&nbsp; And yet they are not recondite, but so
intelligible to educated English <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>people, that some years ago as a
matter of edification I went through them, with a class of fifty
of the laity in my parish, and a few clergy, who for several
weeks were glad to devote attention to the subject; and I venture
to think that the idea never occurred to one of us, that there
was the least want of harmony between the two documents.&nbsp; We
really did not see the &ldquo;calm image of Cranmer&rdquo;
reflected on the surface of the &ldquo;Liturgy,&rdquo; as Lord
Macaulay fancied he did (p. 18); and as to the &ldquo;foul weeds
in which the roots were buried,&rdquo; we did not discover them
there;&mdash;(nor did Lord Macaulay, I suppose, as it was not his
custom to go to these &ldquo;roots.&rdquo;)&nbsp; I think I am
entitled, then, to meet the charge of the
&ldquo;contradictoriness&rdquo; of the Articles and the
Prayer-book, with an assertion that there is a thorough inward
harmony, which not a few of us feel; and we cannot be talked out
of this conviction by the contrary assertions of microscopic
thinkers.&nbsp; I should grant, of course, that it would be a
&ldquo;practical evil&rdquo; of no small kind, demanding
immediate redress, if I could admit any real opposition between
the Formularies which we have to sign.&nbsp; But I unreservedly
deny it.&nbsp; I know indeed what objectors would mean when they
say this: but I know also that the same objectors would find
&ldquo;contradictoriness&rdquo; in different parts of Holy
Scripture; and I am thankful that I do not find it, after many
years&rsquo; steady work at both Old Testament and New.</p>
<h4><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>The
early age of those who &ldquo;subscribe.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Another alleged grievance, or &ldquo;practical
evil,&rdquo; is said to be the age <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a> at which young men
are called on to make these important professions of their
belief.&nbsp; I had, many years since, to encounter the same
objection in another form.&nbsp; I met with some among the
Baptists, who objected to teaching children to &ldquo;say their
prayers,&rdquo; on the ground that they could not understand the
mysterious subjects implied; and others who would not ask them to
believe any thing in Religion, until they had proved it.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;practical evil&rdquo; is&mdash;and I am sure that your
Lordship will agree with me&mdash;altogether on the side of those
who leave the young thus to make their own opinions, and find
their faith how they can.&nbsp; The Bible is, in many respects, a
more complex book than the Prayer-book; and yet I can ask my
child to put entire faith in it, as God&rsquo;s Word.&nbsp; Nor
can the faithful Churchman, I believe, feel any difficulty in
giving into the hands of young and old, the Formularies which
have been his own comfort and help hitherto, and asking their
&ldquo;assent and consent&rdquo; to all that which he knows to be
true.</p>
<h4>Men of ability will not take Holy Orders.</h4>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; There is a &ldquo;practical evil,&rdquo; which has
of late been greatly pressed on public notice, which Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span> thus refers to (p.
30)&mdash;&ldquo;Intelligent, thoughtful, highly educated young
men, who twenty <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>or thirty years ago were to be found in every
Ordination, are gradually withheld from the service of the
Church, and from the profession to which their tastes, their
characters, and their gifts, best fit them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is an evil, the existence of which I shall not
question&mdash;it is indeed too plain, and too alarming to admit
of any doubt.&nbsp; But I deny that it has any foundation in the
practice of Subscription; which has not been changed, or made
more rigid, in our days.&nbsp; I have never known one
conscientious, thoughtful young churchman kept from Holy Orders
by a shrinking from Subscription.&nbsp; They who have shrunk have
been persons who <i>differ</i> from the Church, and
<i>acknowledge</i> the fact.&nbsp; They have been men, like my
upright friend Mr. Fisher,&mdash;the author of &ldquo;Liturgical
Revision,&rdquo;&mdash;who would not, for all the temptations
that might be offered, use the entire Offices of our Church, even
if ordained immediately without Subscription.&nbsp; Subscription
keeps them out, of course.&nbsp; It is meant to do so, if it has
any meaning at all.&nbsp; But if we look around us at the state
of things in the Church, during the twenty or thirty years to
which Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> alludes, we shall
not find it difficult to ascertain causes which have kept, and
will keep, so many intelligent and conscientious minds of the
higher order, from entering the ministry of the Church.&nbsp;
Young men of ability in the last generation, if designed for Holy
Orders, gave themselves to Theological study.&nbsp; But we all
remember the panic which arose in consequence of the secessions
to the Roman Church.&nbsp; Public patronage and popular feeling
were then so successfully <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>worked on, by the fanatical portion
of the press, that the bare rumour of &ldquo;Theological
learning&rdquo; was enough to mark any Churchman for
suspicion.&nbsp; Parents who did not wish their more gifted sons
to be victims, chose for them other callings, and found a
thousand new and attractive openings in the Civil service.&nbsp;
Youths of greatest promise saw encouragement in other
professions, and rewards in the distance for successful merit;
but if they began to read Theology, they soon found themselves
obliged to pause.&nbsp; To read St. Augustine, till you began to
believe the ancient doctrine of Baptism, was fatal: to study
Church history, or the Liturgies, was still worse,&mdash;if men
did it honestly.&nbsp; Hundreds, I believe, were thus beaten
off.&nbsp; Parents and guardians and friends could not desire
social and professional neglect&mdash;if not worse&mdash;for
those in whom they were interested.&nbsp; They saw and said, that
&ldquo;there was but little chance for a clever man,&rdquo; if he
had the stigma of high ability or learning.&nbsp; If such a man
as Dr. <span class="smcap">Mill</span>&mdash;to whose writings
men readily seek, now that the infidel is at our doors&mdash;if
he died in comparative obscurity and neglect, what could others
look for?&nbsp; The evil is done, and none now living will see it
completely undone.&mdash;</p>
<p>To crush the principles of old Churchmanship was not, however,
a task to which the rising intellect of Oxford would lend itself;
it retired and left that work to others; or it strayed into
German literature, whither the popular hatred had not yet learned
to track it: and now the wail goes forth from <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>&ldquo;Charge&rdquo; after &ldquo;Charge,&rdquo; that
men of higher minds have fled, or turned
&ldquo;neologians!&rdquo;&nbsp; Is there no Nemesis here?&mdash;A
few years since, the Church&rsquo;s rapid descent from her
position of ancient learning was regarded with a quiet despair by
some even of our most thoughtful men.&nbsp; A late dignitary even
expressed &ldquo;thankfulness&rdquo; on one occasion at some
moderate-looking promotion that had been made in high places, and
he was remonstrated with by one who knew the entire ignorance of
theology of the clergyman who had just been honoured.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, he is wholly ignorant of Christianity!&rdquo; was, I
believe, the exclamation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the
answer, &ldquo;but he is not <i>hostile</i> to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But will any relaxation of
&ldquo;Subscription&rdquo;&mdash;will the destruction of the
Articles, or the Revision of the Liturgy by &ldquo;the
Association&rdquo; set up of late, bring back Theological
learning, or tempt the &ldquo;higher minds&rdquo; into the
Church&rsquo;s ranks?&nbsp; No one can imagine it.&nbsp; A great
misfortune has happened to us, and the way to repair it is not
easily seen; but it is something to see the evil itself.&nbsp;
The Romanizing movement was a great misfortune: we all deplore
it, even those who know that it was provoked by the narrow-minded
treatment which it received.&nbsp; But the loss of Theology and
high intellect is a greater misfortune by far; and this will be
yet found, when the dulness of a coming generation has to defend
the Bible apart from the Church.</p>
<h3>The Athanasian Creed.</h3>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; In discussing the &ldquo;practical evils&rdquo; of
Subscription, I observe that Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span> occasionally singles <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>out parts of
our &ldquo;Formularies,&rdquo; as involving special difficulty,
and embarrassing &ldquo;subscribers&rdquo; in a more painful way
than others.&nbsp; More than once he mentions the Creed of St.
Athanasius as a peculiar hardship.&nbsp; In the first place, he
somewhat roughly and unfairly charges <i>falsehood</i> on the
Article for calling it St. Athanasius&rsquo;s (p. 13); but surely
he would not mean to charge falsehood on the Prayer-book, for
speaking of the &ldquo;<i>Apostles</i> Creed&rdquo;&mdash;and yet
the Apostles did not write it,&mdash;or of the
&ldquo;<i>Nicene</i> Creed,&rdquo; although the latter part of it
be not Nicene?&nbsp; The meaning is so plain and easy, that I own
that I wonder at the tone of Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span> here. <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a>&nbsp; The Creed
&ldquo;commonly <i>called</i> Athanasian&rdquo; is surely a good
description of a document which expresses well the truth which
Athanasius defended, and the Church, by saying &ldquo;commonly
called,&rdquo; expressly refrains from certifying his
authorship.&nbsp; But the admission of the Creed itself is the
evident grievance, and so there is anger at the very name.&nbsp;
To this, then, I will address myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a doctrine most explicitly asserted by the
Liturgy,&rdquo; Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> mentions
&ldquo;the condemnation of <i>all members</i> of the Eastern
Church, as maintained by the clauses of the Athanasian Creed,
which appear to declare that those who refuse to acknowledge the
<span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> to proceed from the <span
class="smcap">Father</span> and the <span
class="smcap">Son</span>, without doubt perish
everlastingly.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>An &ldquo;eminent prelate&rdquo;
twenty years ago, we are told, expressed a devout hope that,
&ldquo;for the honour of human nature, no one now would
deliberately aver&rdquo; this!&nbsp; I hope I shall not seem to
be harsh if I say I would here put in one word &ldquo;for the
honour&rdquo; of common sense, which seems shocked by such
treatment of such subjects.&nbsp; We might as fairly say, that
the words, &ldquo;Whosoever will be saved must thus <i>think</i>
of the Trinity,&rdquo; consign all infants, and persons of little
understanding, to everlasting perdition, because they cannot
&ldquo;think&rdquo; of it at all.&nbsp; It is trifling to
confound the <i>intellectual</i> reception of a doctrine with its
<i>saving</i> reception, and it is saying that none but very
clever people will be saved.&nbsp; Such confusion is equivalent
to a rejection of even the simplest form of Creed.&nbsp; Take for
example the Ethiopian&rsquo;s confession, &ldquo;I believe that
<span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> is the <span
class="smcap">Son</span> of <span
class="smcap">God</span>,&rdquo; on which he was baptized (Acts
viii. 37).&nbsp; For the intellectual conception here demands
explanation at once.&nbsp; In what sense is He the <span
class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp;
Are we not all &ldquo;<span class="smcap">His</span>
offspring?&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Is Jesus</span> the
<span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>
as man? or as <span class="smcap">God</span>?&mdash;or
both?&nbsp; If <span class="smcap">His Son</span>, is He
Eternal?&mdash;and soon.&nbsp; Such questions are
<i>inevitable</i>, if we would really <i>know</i> our meaning in
saying, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> is the
<span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But important as a right
understanding of truth assuredly is, no Church ever thus taught
that intellectual reception of truth could be attained by the
multitude, for whose salvation we labour.&nbsp; If, indeed, we
could look into the mind of the majority of good Christians, <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>and see the
shape which doctrines there take, we should often find the
greatest amount of heresy of the intellect co-existing with
orthodoxy of heart.&nbsp; A statement thus drawn out at length in
a Creed is the Church&rsquo;s intellectual exposition, as far as
it goes, of the Doctrine professed.&nbsp; The million may not
know this; but the Church tells them&mdash;&ldquo;If you hold the
true doctrine, <i>this</i> is <i>what</i>, consciously or not,
you are holding.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Athanasian Creed is a
<i>statement</i> of that truth which dwells in every Christian
heart.&nbsp; We know that God&rsquo;s grace in the soul is always
&ldquo;orthodox;&rdquo; but &ldquo;with the heart man believeth
unto righteousness;&rdquo; but the Creed forbids the intellect to
misinterpret what the heart has savingly known.&mdash;The
agreement with the Eastern Church attempted at the Council of
Florence illustrates this; for it was evidently on this
basis.&nbsp; The Greeks were not told that their forefathers had
all perished, but that their <i>expression</i> of the truth which
they held was less perfect than the Latin.</p>
<p>It may be very easy to misrepresent what is thus said; but
few, on reflection, will venture to say the opposite.&nbsp; Dr.
<span class="smcap">Stanley</span> would not say that <i>no</i>
truth in Scripture is &ldquo;necessary to salvation?&rdquo;&nbsp;
He would not say that <i>no</i> doctrine of any Creed is
&ldquo;necessary to salvation?&rdquo;&nbsp; But yet he would not
say that right intellectual conceptions of any truth, or of any
doctrine, are &ldquo;necessary to salvation?&rdquo;&nbsp; And as
he <i>would</i> own that <i>some</i> faith is necessary, or a
&ldquo;grace of faith&rdquo; (the &ldquo;Habitus Fidei&rdquo; of
the Schools), he must own, therefore, that saving <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>faith,
however unintellectual, is, as I said, orthodox.&nbsp; To
&ldquo;hold the Faith&rdquo; is one thing; to apprehend its
intellectual expression is another.&nbsp; And if all this be
undeniable, what sad unreality it is, to write and speak, as so
many do of the Athanasian Creed, as if it required a
comprehension of all the terms which it uses!&mdash;instead of a
pure &ldquo;holding&rdquo; of the <span
class="smcap">Truth</span>, which it would explain to all capable
of the explanation.</p>
<p>I have dwelt at this length on a single point because, even in
our journals and periodicals, so much obstinate
nonsense&mdash;pardon me, my Lord, for such plainness&mdash;is
frequently uttered against a Creed to which, under <span
class="smcap">God</span>, England now probably owes her
undeniably deep faith in the <span
class="smcap">Trinity</span>.&mdash;To sign the Athanasian Creed
being thus beyond dispute to sign the <span
class="smcap">Doctrine</span>, and not to say that each
expression of it is infallible, or <i>down to the level of all
men</i>, there can be no more objection to Subscription of that
Creed, than of the Apostles&rsquo; or the Nicene.</p>
<h4>Equivocal subscribing.</h4>
<p>(5.)&nbsp; Yet one more &ldquo;evil&rdquo; alleged to flow
from the present practice of &ldquo;Subscription&rdquo; must be
noticed,&mdash;the necessity which it throws on <i>all</i> of us
to sign in a qualified, and therefore not straightforward
sense.&nbsp; &ldquo;From the Archbishop in his palace at Lambeth
to the humblest curate in the wilds of Cumberland,&rdquo; says
Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>, &ldquo;all must go
out,&rdquo; if only the &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; and
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; meaning of the whole Prayer-book be
insisted on.&mdash;I really feel, my Lord, on reading these
words, very much as I should on hearing from a foreigner anything
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>very ultra
and impossible about England&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, that &ldquo;we
have no religion at all in England;&rdquo; (we are told, indeed,
that in Spain we are thought to be an infidel people).&nbsp; The
only answer, in such case, is to inform the foreigner as to the
facts; point to our churches, our schools, our parishes, our
homes.&nbsp; In truth, Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>
here seems to me to write like one who does not know us at
all.&nbsp; I say for myself (and I believe that thousands would
do the same), that I subscribe both Articles and Prayer-book in
their obvious, easy, and most congruous sense, and believe them
to express, if not always in the words which I should have
chosen, yet always in suitable words, my inward convictions of
Christian truth.&nbsp; Indeed, my Lord, I can understand nothing
else.&nbsp; I have moved very freely for many years among my
brethren, and I can but say that my experience of them as a body
does not in any degree correspond with the representation which
Dr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> makes, which I think will
surprise both our friends and our enemies.&nbsp; I can do no
more, of course, than simply protest <a name="citation36"></a><a
href="#footnote36" class="citation">[36]</a> against it with all
my heart; believing fully that when the Articles and the
Prayer-book are interpreted, not with &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo;
perverseness, but honestly and humanly, they are ordinarily found
accordant with reason, with Scripture, and with themselves.</p>
<p>The possible haste with which Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span> seems to have written, may account,
perhaps, for statements <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>so unqualified as these, and some
others that he has made.&nbsp; Indeed, there are things put out
in <i>the Letter</i> which can only be thus explained.&nbsp; I
refer, for instance, to such assertions as that, (p. 4)
which,&mdash;forgetting the whole calendar of Lessons, (and also
the Article vi.), says,&mdash;&ldquo;The Articles and Liturgy
express <i>no opinion</i> as to the authorship of <i>the
disputed</i> <a name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a> or anonymous books of
Scripture,&rdquo;&mdash;and then in a note mentions the
&ldquo;Visitation of the Sick&rdquo; as the only portion of the
&ldquo;Liturgy&rdquo; (<i>sic</i>)&mdash;which refers a disputed
book (the &ldquo;Hebrews&rdquo;) to its author; though the
service for Holy Matrimony equally refers that Epistle to St.
Paul.&nbsp; Or, as another instance, I may name Dr. <span
class="smcap">Stanley&rsquo;s</span> conceiving the
indiscriminate use of our Burial Service to imply some theory
about the happiness of all hereafter.&nbsp; (So I understand him,
at least, p. 19.)&mdash;Or, yet another; his supposing (p. 45)
that the description of our &ldquo;Canonical Books&rdquo; as
those of whose authority there was <i>no doubt</i> &ldquo;<i>in
the Church</i>,&rdquo; could possibly mean &ldquo;no doubt in the
minds of any <i>individuals</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; But, my Lord, my
object is not to find fault with any one; I had to show, as I
hope I have shown, the fallacy of the grounds on which the
surrender of Subscription to the Prayer-book has been urged.</p>
<h3><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>Summary.</h3>
<p>It has been seen that the &ldquo;Comprehension&rdquo; scheme
of the Revolution,&mdash;the design of the English
Reformation,&mdash;and the custom of the Early Church, which had
all been appealed to, <i>all</i> fail to give the least support
to the theory of license now put forward.&nbsp; It has been seen,
that no real argument against Subscription has been deduced from
the practice of it among ourselves, or from the character of our
Formularies.&nbsp; I might have gone farther.&nbsp; I might have
marked the Providential nature of the events which held our
vessel by the anchor of Subscription, at a time when it must have
otherwise drifted on rocks.&nbsp; I might have pointed to the
unhappy results which thus far have attended relaxations of
Subscription, in a change of <i>tone</i> among a large number of
the younger members of the Church and the University, and an
acknowledged failure at length of the supply of candidates for
Holy Orders.&nbsp; But there is no need that I should enlarge on
details which are patent to all observation.&nbsp; It is becoming
that I should bring these remarks to a conclusion.</p>
<p>I should be sorry, indeed, my Lord, if it could be thought
from my deprecating the proposed abolition of Subscription, that
I regard the condition of the Church among us as a normal or
satisfactory one.&nbsp; But I feel, as thousands do, that
whatever changes may lie before us, they should be towards
increased <i>organization of</i> our Body; while the present
proposal would disorganize us at once, and break away the
traditions by which, in an undisciplined age, Providence
protected us.&nbsp; This proposal, I am <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>aware,
unhappily falls in with the spirit of our times&mdash;a spirit of
independence and freedom, rather than of holiness and faith, and
therefore I fear that it will find a wide advocacy among those
who desire not the maintenance of our Church&rsquo;s distinctive
position among the Churches of Europe.&nbsp; Your
Lordship&rsquo;s eloquent hope&mdash;admirable and
strong&mdash;that we may yet &ldquo;maintain that Eternal Truth
of which the Church is the depository, and that Form of sound
words in which that Eternal Truth has been handed down,&rdquo; I
fain would share.&nbsp; But I stand in doubt.&nbsp; I feel very
much like one who is asked to take leave of a peaceful
abode&mdash;a haven of long Providential refuge; and I take,
perhaps, a partial, because parting look at the solid advantages
hitherto secured&mdash;the homely, perhaps, but very real
blessings of a Fixed Faith for our people in general, with Means
of Grace, capable of enlargement everywhere according to our
need, venerable Traditions protecting our noble English Bibles,
our glorious English Offices, our restored English
Churches.&nbsp; The thought of turning one&rsquo;s back on all,
and pushing out on the boundless ocean of opinion, may well fill
the heart with foreboding&mdash;if not for oneself, yet for
others!</p>
<h3>Prospects.</h3>
<p>A solemn future, it may be, is before us as a Church.&nbsp;
You have come, my Lord, to the government of this great central
Diocese at a crisis unparalleled in our history.&nbsp; The
eighteenth century was a great truce of principles.&nbsp; The
truce was probably broken in 1829; efforts were made to
re-establish the truce once more, but not with much <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>success.&nbsp; The Established Church, seemed hastening
to become an established theory only.&nbsp; But new life from God
entered into her.&nbsp; She again delivered her message to the
growing masses of the people,&mdash;and with an energy before but
rarely known.&nbsp; True, our &ldquo;Discipline&rdquo; is not
restored; but the voice of Worship is heard rising anew on every
hand.&mdash;True, there is no startling growth of
Sanctity&mdash;(the special token of a Church&rsquo;s life!); but
there is a very real zeal to do a work for <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> on earth.&nbsp; With all the
experience of an eventful Past to warn us, and the vast range of
Sacred Ministrations still remaining, might it not be the
glorious distinction of your Lordship&rsquo;s Episcopate, that it
gathered together all the remaining elements of our Spiritual
System, so that &ldquo;nothing was lost,&rdquo;&mdash;and saved
for posterity the grandest fabric of Faith and Truth among the
nations of Christendom?&mdash;</p>
<p>But a darker alternative is possible&mdash;may Providence
guide and protect your Lordship, that so it may be
averted!&mdash;A nation finally unchurched;&mdash;a Bible keenly
&ldquo;criticised,&rdquo; and unauthorized;&mdash;a Clergy
descending to &ldquo;use&rdquo; a Prayer-book which they will not
affirm that they <span class="GutSmall">BELIEVE</span>; a People
mainly divided between illiterate fanaticism and cold
infidelity.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
